<h1 align="center"> ORM & Sequelize </h1>

The goal during this project was creating an application for a free course english school, developing a database and its tables to store data on the students, teachers, groups, levels and enrollment.

Along with the data to be stored, HTTP routes and requests were also developed in order to provide CRUD operations: consulting all or a specific id, as well as adding, removing or updating information on different tables.  

Regarding the topics to be studied, Sequelize was the technogy chosen to present the concept of Object Relational Mapping.

# Technologies

First time using:
- body-parser
- MySQL
- Sequelize

Familiar technologies:
- Express
- Nodemon
- Node.js

# Experience

Never before I had in the same project this amount of dependancies. Although I had familiarity with some of them already, during this time improved my experience with Express, making it easier to undestand and use it in future projects. 

On the other hand, I had some difficulties making MySQL work on the project. As it was my first time using it, I had some trouble making it work. Over the course, some instructions did not work and so  I had to search different solutions for the issues I had while creating the database. Besides that, I could learn some MySQL commands to test seeding and migrations.

Sequelize commands were used to create the models, the methods for the classes and the association among tables. Seeds were used to populate the tables.

By the end of the course I could better understand how to use MVC to structure and organize the project.
